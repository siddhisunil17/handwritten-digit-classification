# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
A classification pipeline for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

Introduction
This project provides an interpretation and results from various machine learning models used for the MNIST handwritten digit classification task. 
The models tested include:
Logistic Regression
RidgeClassifier
Random Forest
XGBoost (on PCA-reduced and noisy data)

The performance metrics, cross-validation results, and confusion matrices are analyzed to determine the best-performing model for deployment.

Results Summary
The result summarizes the performance of the models based on Accuracy, F1-Score (Test), Cross-Validation Mean F1-Score, and Standard Deviation. 
Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model with the highest accuracy and F1-Score, indicating its robustness for this task.
